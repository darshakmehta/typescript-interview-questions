# Solution 1:

```
const identity<Type> = (arg: Type): Type => {
  return arg;
};
```

## Hint:

The issue is with the syntax for declaring a generic function. The correct syntax should place the generic type parameter in angle brackets after the function name, not after the const keyword. Here is the corrected code:

# Solution 2:

```
const identity = <Type>(arg: Type): Type => {
  return arg;
};
```

## Hint

The issue is that the TypeScript compiler is interpreting the <Type> syntax as a JSX element. To fix this, you need to use the extends keyword to declare the generic type parameter correctly.

# Correct Solution

```
const identity = <Type extends unknown>(arg: Type): Type => {
  return arg;
};
```
